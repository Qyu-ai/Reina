## About Example Notebooks

The notebooks assume a test_data.csv generated by the following code snippet (Python):    

    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.rand(5000000,7))
    df.columns = ['var1', 'var2', 'var3', 'var4', 'var5', 'treatment', 'outcome']
    df.treatment = np.random.randint(2, size=df.shape[0])
    df.to_csv("test_data.csv")

The purpose of these notebooks is just to demonstrate how to get started with our package. 
The dataset is randomly generated and the treatment effects have no meaning. Demo with actual datasets and meaningful effects will come soon.
