## About Example Notebooks

The notebooks assume a test_data.csv generated by the following code snippet (Python):    

    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.rand(1000, 7))  # Sample size is arbitrary. Could increase size if you'd like to try toy big-data.
    df.columns = ['var1', 'var2', 'var3', 'var4', 'var5', 'treatment', 'outcome']
    df.treatment = np.random.randint(2, size=df.shape[0])
    df.to_csv("test_data.csv")

The purpose of these notebooks is just to demonstrate how to get started with our package. For simplicity, the data is small (1000 samples) and is randomly generated. Hence, the treatment effects produced in the scripts have no meaning. If you'd like to try out big-data processing, please increase the sample size to 50M+.

Demo with actual datasets and meaningful effects will come soon.
