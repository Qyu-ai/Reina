## Issues

A good issue includes a [short, self contained, correct example](http://sscce.org/) of the problem.

It is even better if you provide details regarding recreating the issue.  
**Warning:** you may want to remove some private information (authentication information is removed, but there may be private stuff in the messages)

If for any reason you are not able to do that, open your issue anyway and a maintainer will see what is needed to solve your problem.

## Pull Requests

Pull Requests should clearly describe two things:

1. The problem they attempt to solve
2. How the author went about solving the problem

Ideally, changes should be made in logical commits and tests added to expand and improve Reina's Causal Infernce for Big Data capibilities.  

## Coding style

Reina adopts the black coding style.
