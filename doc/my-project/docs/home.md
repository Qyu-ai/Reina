## About
ReInA (Reasoning In AI) is a causal inference platform aimed at estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in observational data. There are various open-source projects that provide convenient causal inference methods, but the current out-of-box packages are limited to local memory for computation. Hence, this project integrates Apache Spark with various machine learning (ML) powered causal inference frameworks, enabling causal analysis on big-data.
